This is a new authentication system that validates user for accessing the system only when they submit correct password. This avoids unauthorized user entering into the system. In this project, the password allows the characters, numbers, special characters, SPACES as well as BACKSPACE as characters during the registration. The password validates only when the registered password is used for login which includes the spaces and backspaces.
The password file is stored in an encrypted form in the database . This way there would be negligible chances of bot or anyone to crack password through shoulder surfing.
Hence this project is aimed to achieve the highest security in authenticating users.
